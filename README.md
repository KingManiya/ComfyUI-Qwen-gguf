# ComfyUI LLM Text Processor

Process text and images with GGUF LLMs in ComfyUI using llama.cpp, including
Qwen3-VL, Qwen3.5, Qwen3.6, Gemma 4, and gpt-oss.

This extension adds a local LLM node for prompt writing, prompt rewriting,
translation, captioning, extraction, and other text processing tasks inside
ComfyUI. It discovers local GGUF models from `ComfyUI/models/LLM`, and it can
also accept a single image or a ComfyUI image batch for multimodal models that
use an external `mmproj`.

## Features

- Text generation and text transformation with local GGUF models
- Optional image input for multimodal llama.cpp models that use `mmproj`,
  including multi-image batches
- Separate `RESPONSE` and `REASONING` outputs
- System prompt presets from text files
- Recursive model discovery from `ComfyUI/models/LLM`
- Automatic llama.cpp setup on supported Windows and Ubuntu systems
- Download progress logs during automatic llama.cpp setup
- Advanced llama.cpp options for users who need them
- Optional `enable_processing` toggle for switching between node processing and direct passthrough

## Supported Model Families

Works with local GGUF models for Qwen, Gemma 4, gpt-oss, and other
llama.cpp-compatible families.

Common examples:

- Qwen text and vision families such as `Qwen3-VL`, `Qwen3.5`, and `Qwen3.6`
- Gemma 4 GGUF models such as `gemma-4-E2B`, `gemma-4-E4B`,
  `gemma-4-26b-a4b`, and `gemma-4-31b`
- OpenAI `gpt-oss-20b` and `gpt-oss-120b`

Notes:

- For image workflows, choose a matching `mmproj` file from the same model
  family when the GGUF release provides one.
- Gemma 4 text generation works well. Vision support depends on the specific
  GGUF and `mmproj` release, and can be less reliable on some GPU backends.
- In this node, `gpt-oss` is used as a text model through
  llama.cpp-compatible GGUF releases.

## Installation

### ComfyUI Manager

Open ComfyUI Manager, choose `Install Custom Nodes`, search for
`LLM Text Processor`, install it, then restart ComfyUI.

### Manual Git Clone

Open a terminal in `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KingManiya/ComfyUI-LLM-text-processor.git
```

Restart ComfyUI. The node appears under:

```text
LLM Text Processor -> LLM Text Processor
```

No extra setup is needed for basic use.

### Example workflow
![Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KingManiya/ComfyUI-LLM-text-processor/refs/heads/images/images/flow.png)

## llama.cpp

The node uses official llama.cpp release binaries. Automatic setup is currently
available on:

```text
Windows x64 + CUDA 13
Ubuntu x64 CPU
Ubuntu x64 Vulkan
Ubuntu x64 ROCm
Ubuntu x64 OpenVINO
Ubuntu arm64 CPU
```

Ubuntu uses the CPU runtime by default because it works on the widest range of
systems. To choose a different Ubuntu x64 runtime, set this environment variable
before starting ComfyUI:

```bash
export LLM_TEXT_PROCESSOR_LLAMA_BACKEND=vulkan
```

Supported Ubuntu x64 values are `cpu`, `vulkan`, `rocm`, and `openvino`.
Ubuntu arm64 currently supports `cpu`.

Other platforms require manual llama.cpp setup.

The extension downloads llama.cpp only. It does not download model weights.

During automatic setup, the console shows download progress, total size when
available, and current download speed so slow connections do not look like a
freeze.

## Model Placement

Put your GGUF files anywhere under:

```text
ComfyUI/models/LLM
```

Example:

```text
ComfyUI/models/LLM/My-Model/model-q4_k_m.gguf
ComfyUI/models/LLM/My-Model/mmproj-bf16.gguf
```

The `model` dropdown shows model `.gguf` files. The `mmproj` dropdown shows
vision projector files and `none`.

For image workflows, choose the `mmproj` file that belongs to the selected
model. You can connect either one image or a ComfyUI image batch; batch items
are sent together in the same llama.cpp request.

## System Prompt Presets

Create text files in:

```text
ComfyUI/models/LLM/prompts
```

Example:

```text
ComfyUI/models/LLM/prompts/captioner.txt
```

Each top-level `.txt` file appears in the `system_prompt` dropdown. Choose
`none` to run without a system prompt.

## Recommended Settings

These presets are a good starting point for common models and tasks.

### Qwen

Qwen starting presets:

| Model family / use case | `reasoning` | `temperature` | `top_p` | `top_k` | `repeat_penalty` |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Qwen3-VL Instruct | `off` | 0.7 | 0.8 | 20 | 1.0 |
| Qwen3-VL Thinking | `on` | 0.6 | 0.95 | 20 | 1.0 |
| Qwen3.5 / Qwen3.6 thinking, general tasks | `on` | 1.0 | 0.95 | 20 | 1.0 |
| Qwen3.5 / Qwen3.6 thinking, precise coding | `on` | 0.6 | 0.95 | 20 | 1.0 |
| Qwen3.5 / Qwen3.6 instruct, general tasks | `off` | 0.7 | 0.8 | 20 | 1.0 |
| Qwen3.5 / Qwen3.6 instruct, reasoning tasks | `off` | 1.0 | 1.0 | 40 | 1.0 |

### Gemma 4

Gemma 4 starting preset:

| Model family / use case | `reasoning` | `temperature` | `top_p` | `top_k` | `repeat_penalty` |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Gemma 4 `it` models, general tasks | `off` | 1.0 | 0.95 | 64 | 1.0 |
| Gemma 4 `it` models, reasoning tasks | `on` | 1.0 | 0.95 | 64 | 1.0 |
| Gemma 4 multimodal tasks | `off` | 1.0 | 0.95 | 64 | 1.0 |

Common Gemma 4 variants:

- `gemma-4-E2B`
- `gemma-4-E4B`
- `gemma-4-26b-a4b`
- `gemma-4-31b`

Gemma 4 supports configurable thinking modes across the family. For simple
prompt writing, translation, captioning, and extraction, start with
`reasoning=off`. For harder reasoning or coding tasks, try `reasoning=on`.

### gpt-oss

gpt-oss starting preset:

| Model family / use case | `reasoning` | `temperature` | `top_p` | `top_k` | `repeat_penalty` |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `gpt-oss-20b`, direct answers and lower-latency local tasks | `off` | 1.0 | 1.0 | 20 | 1.0 |
| `gpt-oss-20b`, reasoning-heavy tasks | `on` | 1.0 | 1.0 | 20 | 1.0 |
| `gpt-oss-120b`, general purpose and stronger reasoning | `on` | 1.0 | 1.0 | 20 | 1.0 |

Use the preset as shown. Leave the other values at default unless you already
know you want different sampling.

Common gpt-oss variants:

- `gpt-oss-20b`
- `gpt-oss-120b`

OpenAI describes `gpt-oss-20b` as the lower-latency option for local or
specialized use cases, and `gpt-oss-120b` as the larger option for production,
general purpose, and higher-reasoning workloads.

OpenAI also documents configurable reasoning effort for `gpt-oss`. This node
does not expose the native low / medium / high control directly, so the presets
above use the simpler `reasoning` toggle available here: start with `off` for
direct answers, and try `on` for harder reasoning tasks.

## Node Inputs

| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `model` | GGUF model file from `ComfyUI/models/LLM`. |
| `mmproj` | Vision projector GGUF. Required when using image input, whether it is one image or a batch. |
| `system_prompt` | Prompt preset from `models/LLM/prompts`, or `none`. |
| `prompt` | User prompt sent to the selected model. |
| `max_tokens` | Maximum generated tokens. |
| `temperature` | Sampling temperature. Lower values are more deterministic. |
| `top_p` | Nucleus sampling threshold. |
| `top_k` | Top-K sampling cutoff. |
| `repeat_penalty` | Penalty for repeated tokens. |
| `ctx_size` | Context window size. Larger values use more memory. |
| `memory_mode` | Advanced memory placement mode: `auto`, `gpu_layers`, `cpu_moe_layers`, or `gpu_and_cpu_moe_layers`. |
| `n_gpu_layers` | Used only in `gpu_layers` and `gpu_and_cpu_moe_layers` modes. |
| `n_cpu_moe_layers` | Used only in `cpu_moe_layers` and `gpu_and_cpu_moe_layers` modes. |
| `seed` | Random seed. Use `-1` for a random seed. |
| `timeout_seconds` | Maximum runtime before generation is stopped. |
| `reasoning` | Reasoning output mode: `auto`, `on`, or `off`. |
| `image` | Optional image input. Accepts a single image or a ComfyUI batch, and sends the batch together to llama.cpp. |
| `enable_processing` | When enabled, the node runs normally. When disabled, the node forwards `prompt` directly to `RESPONSE` and skips all model checks and llama.cpp execution. |
| `extra_args` | Optional advanced llama.cpp parameters. Leave empty for normal use. |

## Node Outputs

| Output | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `RESPONSE` | Final model response with reasoning blocks removed, or the input `prompt` when `enable_processing` is disabled. |
| `REASONING` | Extracted reasoning when present in model output. Empty when `enable_processing` is disabled. |
| `PERF` | Prompt and generation speed reported by llama.cpp. Empty when `enable_processing` is disabled. |

## Troubleshooting

### No models appear

Place at least one `.gguf` model under:

```text
ComfyUI/models/LLM
```

Then refresh or restart ComfyUI.

### Image input fails

Make sure `mmproj` is not set to `none` and that the projector belongs to the
same model family as the selected GGUF model.

### llama.cpp setup fails

Check your internet connection and GitHub access, then run the node again.
On Ubuntu GPU backends, also check that the matching system runtime is
installed and visible to the ComfyUI process:

- `vulkan` requires a working Vulkan driver.
- `rocm` requires a working ROCm runtime.
- `openvino` requires the OpenVINO runtime expected by the llama.cpp release.

### Unsupported platform

Automatic llama.cpp setup currently supports Windows x64 CUDA 13 and Ubuntu
Linux x64/arm64. On Ubuntu x64, set `LLM_TEXT_PROCESSOR_LLAMA_BACKEND` to
`cpu`, `vulkan`, `rocm`, or `openvino`; if it is unset, `cpu` is used.

### Out of memory

Lower `ctx_size` first. If that is not enough, use a smaller model, a smaller
quant, or adjust memory placement.

### Generation takes too long

Try lowering `max_tokens`, reducing `ctx_size`, using a smaller GGUF model, or
increasing `timeout_seconds`.

Use `extra_args` only if you already know which llama.cpp options your setup
needs.

### Response is empty or cut off

Increase `max_tokens`. This is especially important when `reasoning` is set to
`on` or `auto`, because the model can spend part of the token budget on
reasoning before it reaches the final answer.
